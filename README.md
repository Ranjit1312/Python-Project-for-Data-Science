# Python-Project-for-Data-Science
Python Project for Data Science: IBM Data Science Certification

## Overview 
In this project we will extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data we will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends..The stocks worked on areTesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed
A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. We will be using Plotly in this project for data visualization.

## Stock Shared

A company's stock share is a piece of the company; more precisely:
A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This
entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." [1]
An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases,
the investor with incur a loss.  Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day. The stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges. 

In this project, we will use the  y-finance API to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock. You will then be asked questions about your results.
